        Table #1
            Scheduled scans - industry-level
            Currently scanning
            Scanned - now in selection/validation process
            Selected Accounts (TAL) - ready for automation (once they're there, shouldn't they be seen in another view, like cleaner TAl list, more added value?)

        Table #2
            Scheduled scans - employees in accounts
            Currently scanning
            Scanned - now in selection/validation process
